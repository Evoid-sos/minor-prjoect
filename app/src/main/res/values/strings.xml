    <string name="cyber_security_guidelines_details">
                    1. Make the passwords more complicated by combining letters, numbers, special
                        characters (minimum 10 characters in total) and change them on a regular
                        basis.\n\n
                    2. Use anti-virus/malware software\n\n
                    3. Prevent spyware from infiltrating your computer by installing and updating
                        anti-spyware software.\n\n
                    4. Make sure your social networking profiles (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, YouTube,
                        MSN, etc.) are set to private.\n\n
                    5. Be careful what information you post online. Once it is on the Internet,
                        it is there forever\n\n
                    6. Turn on automatic updates to prevent potential attacks on older
                        software.\n\n
                    7. Public Wi-Fi, a.k.a. “Hot Spots”, are also vulnerable. Avoid conducting
                        financial or corporate transactions on these networks.\n\n
                    8. Always think before you click on a link or file of unknown
                        origin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

    <string name="fire_guidelines_details">
                    1. Immediately pull the nearest fire alarm pull station as you exit the
                        building\n\n
                    2. When evacuating the building, be sure to feel doors for heat before opening
                        them to be sure there is no fire danger on the other side.\n\n
                    3. If there is smoke in the air, stay low to the ground, especially your head,
                        to reduce inhalation exposure. Keep on hand on the wall to prevent
                        disorientation and crawl to the nearest exit.\n\n
                    4. Once away and clear from danger, call your report contact and inform them
                        of the fire.\n\n
                    5. Go to your refuge area and await further instructions from emergency
                        personnel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

                    1. Keep a first-aid kit handy at home and work\n\n
                    2. Having an emergency app on your smartphone allows first responders access
                        to critical medical information stored on your phone without knowing the
                        passcode on the phone’s lock screen. Information can include prescriptions,
                        allergies, medical conditions, blood type and emergency contacts.\n\n
                    3. If you do have to go the ER, be prepared. Bring a list of current
                        medications, including how long the medicine has been taken and how
                        often.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

                    1. The first and foremost thing is your own safety, this will enable you to
                        help others and get time to analyze the complete situation with a better
                        viewpoint.\n\n
                    2. Once you have reached safety, the next step is to make sure that everyone
                        involved in the accident is safe and assess your own and their possible
                        injuries.\n \n
                    3. Once everyone involved has been diagnosed to be safe, it is imperative
                        that you file a police report of the accident at the earliest and in as
                        detailed a manner as you can manage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

                    2. Walk with your head upright. Make eye contact. Thieves often target victims
                        who are not paying attention to their surroundings or who are looking
                        down.\n\n
                    3. Plan your route, know where you are going before leaving.\n\n
                    4. Stick to well-lighted, well-traveled streets. Avoid shortcuts through
                        wooded areas, parking lots, or alleys.\n\n\n\n\n
